## 🌊 The Return of the Legend

Long believed to be nothing more than a story whispered across calm waters and cluttered pits, **Nessie** has awakened once more — no longer a fable, no longer a crude collection of wires and willpower. What began as a high school robotics project is now a war machine of code, control, and calculated chaos.

This is not a fork.
This is not a patch.
This is a resurrection.

## 🐉 Born in Myth, Rebuilt in Metal

Where others see tangled wires, we see sinew.  
Where others write functions, we forge instincts.  
Where others debug, we **summon**.

**Nessie** is the culmination of every mistake, every spark, every line of rushed code written on a competition floor five minutes before a match. But this time... it’s intentional. It's clean. It's scalable. It's ready to dominate.

Whether it's auto routines with god-tier precision, subsystems more stable than your WiFi, or controls tighter than a pit crew caffeine schedule, **Nessie** is back — and she’s pissed.

## 🧠 Architecture of a Beast

### ⚙️ Subsystems
Decoupled. Modular. Refactored. No longer duct-taped together by desperation and hope. From drivetrain to manipulator, every system has a mind of its own — and a shared mission: **devour the field**.

### 🎯 Autonomous Logic
Paths that don’t miss. Sensors that don’t lie. A decision engine sharper than your driver’s reflexes. When the buzzer sounds, Nessie moves with purpose, grace, and occasionally... terrifying aggression.

### 🕹️ Operator Interface
Designed for speed, clarity, and complete control. Drivers don't just operate Nessie — they **unleash** her.

### 🔥 Utilities
Logging, tuning, fail-safes. Built not just for matches but for meltdowns. When the world goes sideways, Nessie keeps crawling forward.

## 🤝 Join the Hunt

This isn’t a solo story — it's a **legend in the making**, and legends are written by the brave:

- Submit issues, not excuses.
- Fork, improve, and contribute with honor.
- Document like you’re leaving instructions for future archaeologists.

If you add something awesome, Nessie will remember you. Forever.

## 🐾 The Legacy Continues

The old Nessie may have been a jank pile of bolts with dreams. But this Nessie?  
She’s sleek.  
She’s furious.  
She’s alive.

And she’s coming for the gold.

So whether you're here to contribute, clone, or just stare in awe, remember:

> **You are not working on a robot. You are taming a myth.**

**Nessie**  
_The legend resurfaces._
