# 🐉 Nessie Evo

> _“Do not go looking for monsters in the depths… unless you brought one.”_

Welcome to **Nessie Evo** — the evolution, the uprising, the inevitable reckoning.

This is **not** just robot code. This is not just motors, controllers, and PID loops.  
This is a creature born in the dark trenches of Git commits, hardened by build errors, baptized by blue banners, and awakened by a need for vengeance.

This repo is **the sequel Nessie was afraid of**. Nessie was a myth. **Nessie Evo is a warning.**

## 🧬 Origins

Once upon a regional, we wrote code — and it worked.

Then it failed.

Then it worked again, but only if you didn’t touch the intake command during auto while simultaneously holding A and sacrificing a USB cable to the driver station gods.

We named it *Nessie* — a creature of legend. But we needed more. Something scalable. Maintainable. Modular. Less “spaghetti”, more “sashimi.”  
We needed a monster with purpose.

And so we plunged into the abyss and summoned:

## ⚙️ What Is This?

This is not your average “command-based template.”

This is:
- A rearchitected control system
- A smarter autonomous engine
- A streamlined subsystem framework
- A drivebase that bites back
- Logs so detailed they could narrate a David Attenborough documentary

Every line in here has been rewritten, refined, or ritually purified.  
Gone are the sins of blocking commands.  
Banished are the demons of infinite loops.  
Here lies structure. Intent. Power.
